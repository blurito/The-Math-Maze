## My First Project in Python

My checkpoint project submission for Codedex's "The Legend of Python".
This project took me a total of two weeks with learning new things and trying to implement them.
Very proud to present.

### About

This interactive game tests your math skills as you navigate through a challenging maze. Answer math questions correctly to proceed, but beware—three wrong answers and it's game over.


### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins with a prompt asking if you would like to proceed. Type in Yes to start or No to exit.
2. **Solve Math Problems**: Each round presents a different math problem. Enter your answers correctly to move forward.
3. **Limited Tries**: You have three attempts for each question. If you fail to answer correctly within three tries, the game ends.
4. **Choose Your Path**: In later rounds, you will need to choose between different paths, each presenting unique challenges.


### The Code
The code is under TheMathMaze1.0_Code.
Just copy and paste it into python.
